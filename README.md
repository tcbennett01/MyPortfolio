# Personal Portfolio Website

This is the portfolio website I built at local coding bootcamp.  Building the site and blog was our first major project using ASP.NET MVC.  Blog includes secure log-in, authenticated user comments, and moderator capabilities.  Links to subsequent MVC projects and coding challenges were added along the way.  

Note:  the code contained herein is not representative of clean code standards or SOLID principles.  The goal was to learn ASP.NET MVC with minimal supervision by the deadline (i.e., figure it out, build the project, meet acceptance criteria, and clean it up by hard cutoff).  Commented code should be removed, variables renamed, methods and classes refactored into single responsibilities, abstract business logic into services and add interfaces where appropriate.  

## Technologies/Frameworks: Website and Blog
ASP.NET, MVC, some C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and integrated Bootstrap template.
